# CRM System – C# Desktop Application (Team Project)

This CRM system was developed as part of the Software Engineering module at Anglia Ruskin University. The application serves an organization named *Together Culture*, managing membership engagement, events, and admin operations.

This was a group project in the initial stages (requirements and design), but the full implementation presented here was individually developed and submitted.
